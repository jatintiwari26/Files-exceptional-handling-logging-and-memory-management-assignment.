        "\n",
        "How they work:\n",
        "The source code you write is translated (compiled) into machine code by a compiler before you run it.\n",
        "Once compiled, you get an executable file (.exe, .out, etc.) that can run directly on the computer without needing the original source code.\n",

        "Advantages:\n",
